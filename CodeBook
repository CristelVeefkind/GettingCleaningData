Variables used in the script:

The source data read into tables
X_test_table  = "test/X_test.txt"
y_test_table = "test/y_test.txt"
X_train_table = train/X_train.txt
y_train_table = train/y_train.txt
test_subjects = test/subject_test.txt
train_subjects = train/subject_train.txt
features = features.txt
activitylabels  = activity_labels.txt

extra column names:
train_subjects: subjects
test_subjects: subjects
y_train_table: activitycode
y_test_table: activitycode
X_train_table: numbered 1-83
X_test_table: numbereed 1-83
activitylabels: activitycode, activity_desc


combined tables:
xy_train_table  merge of train_subjects, y_train_table and X_train_table
xy_test_table merge of test_subjects,y_test_table and X_test_table
combined train and test:
XY_complete merge of xy_test_table and xy_train_table

subsetting variables:
grep_pattern: std|mean to find the std and mean variables
std_mean_rows: rows in teh features table with the mean and std variables
std_mean_code_vector: vector to use subset XY_complete
std_mean_table: subset of XY_complete of all the variables with std and mean

Result variables:
std_mean_table: result from step 4
Mean_table: resutl from step 5 with only means of all the variables from step 4 grouped by subject and activity and ordered by subject
